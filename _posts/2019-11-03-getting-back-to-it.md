It's been awhile since I've posted anything but I'm hoping to change that, life has just picked up. Over the past several months my team at work has gone under some restructuring, I've joined the Navy Reserves, and I've tried to enjoy what was left of summer.  

Now that I program all day at work, I sometimes find it difficult to stay motivated to do it in my free time. Not that I don't enjoy it, I do and I have so many projects I want to accomplish, but I'm just mentally exhausted from it. I've found a lot of release in going to the gym, seeing friends, or going for a bike ride. Fortunately, for my coding skills at least, the colder weather will lead to more time to focus on projects and to read the stack of books waiting for me.  

Hopefully I'll get back to typing my thoughts on Clean Code and the other books on my list. I've heard really good things about the Progmatic Programmer and would like continue on to that after this book.  

It's crazy to think back and realize that I've a full time developer for almost an entire year. Here's to what comes next!
