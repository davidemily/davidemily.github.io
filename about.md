Hello there, my name is David Emily. I currently sling code for a living at [Veterans United Home Loans](https://www.veteransunited.com/).  

After spending several years in the Navy, I discovered my passion for technology and using it to improve lives. I followed this passion to earn my BS in Computer Science from University of Missouri.  

I wanted a place to talk about my projects and practice my writing skills, so I forked this great blog template and plan to try to add to it as I explore the depths of technology.
