Hello there, my name is David Emily. I currently sling code for a living at [Veterans United Home Loans](https://www.veteransunited.com/).
When I'm not writing software to put veterans into homes, I'm probably at the gym or catching up on my reading. 
I wanted a place to talk about my projects and practice my writing skills, so I forked this great blog template and plan to try to add to it.
